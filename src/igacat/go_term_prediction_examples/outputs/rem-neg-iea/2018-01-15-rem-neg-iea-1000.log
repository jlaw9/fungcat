Setting up evidence code categories
	Ingoring the evidence code 'ND' because it means there is no data available for this protein

pos_neg_ev (used to assign positive and negative examples):
	'EXP','IDA','IPI','IMP','IGI','IEP','ISS','ISO','ISA','ISM','IGC','IBA','IBD','IKR','IRD','RCA','TAS','NAS','IC'
rem_neg_ev (used to remove negative examples):
	'IEA'
ignore_ev (ignored completely when assigning examples):
	'ND'
