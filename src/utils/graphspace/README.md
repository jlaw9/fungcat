This is a generic script to post a list of edges in a file to GraphSpace. I tried to keep as much functionality as I could while making it as simple as possible.

To accomodate more complex popups, you should be able to just import this script, build the popups yourself, and then pass them as input.

TODO Add example edges and graph-attr files
